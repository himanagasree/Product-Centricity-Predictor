Starting at just $599, this flagship costs hundreds less than the iPhone 14 and Galaxy S23 and yet it delivers pretty much everything you could want. The Pixel 7 builds on Google's computational photography prowess, capturing sharp photos while delivering new features like Photo Unblur to rescue blurry shots. There's also a new Cinematic Blur feature for video. And it's all powered by a new Google-made Tensor G2 chip that delivers new experiences and capabilities unique to the Pixel 7 lineup that just might convince people that Google's phones deserve a shot. For all its strengths — and there are many as we'll soon find out in this Google Pixel 7 review — Google's new phone is unlikely to upend the Apple-Samsung duopoly that dominates the smartphone market. But the Pixel 7 could make the case that there are options beyond iPhones and Galaxy devices and offering people an extremely smart smartphone is an awfully good place to start. If you're after a bigger screen and telephoto zoom, check out our Pixel 7 Pro review . Also see our Pixel 7 vs iPhone 14 face-off to see how Google's flagship stacks up to the competition. We've also got a Galaxy S23 vs. Pixel 7 face-off now that Samsung's new flagship has arrived. Google Pixel 7 review: Price and availability The Google Pixel 7 is now on sale, with the 128GB version of the phone starting at $599 / £599/ AU$999. That's the same debut price as Pixel 6 in 2021, with Google looking to maintain a pricing advantage over rival smartphones. Both the iPhone 14 and Samsung Galaxy S23 start at $799 in the US, so you're able to pick up a comparable flagship for $200 less should you opt for Google. The older Galaxy S22 , still available from Samsung, now costs $699, but that's still $100 more than Google's phone. The Pixel 7 features one additional configuration, a 256GB model for $699 / £699 / AU$1,129. Again, that's $100 less than either of the flagship phones from Apple or Samsung in the US, and you're getting double the storage. Pixel 7 deals can help you save additional money on your purchase, and we expect deals to continue even after the phone hits retail shelves. In the US, AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon all offer the Pixel 7, as does Google Fi, Google's in-house wireless service. You can also find the Pixel 7 at some discount carriers including Visible as well as retailers such as Amazon and Best Buy . In addition to the Pixel 7, Google has also released the Pixel 7 Pro , a larger version of the phone that also features a telephoto lens. And if you want a smartwatch to go with your phone, Google now has an entry of its own in the form of the Pixel Watch . Google Pixel 7 review: Design Whether you loved or hated the Pixel 6's design, I hope you got used to it because that distinctive look returns with the Pixel 7. Me, I happen to think the Pixel has the best flagship phone design currently, as I think it helps the phone standout in a sea of cookie-cutter devices with camera arrays jutting out from the back left corner of the handset. (Image credit: Tom's Guide) Instead, the Pixel 7 houses its rear cameras in a bar that stretches the length of the phone. It's a more polished look this year, as the Pixel 7 swaps out its predecessor's plastic camera bar for one made out of aluminum with a handsome matte finish. Aluminum lines the frame of the phone as well. In spite of that, the 6.9-ounce Pixel 7 is actually lighter than the 7.3-ounce Pixel 6, though it still outweighs the iPhone 14 (6.1 ounces) and Galaxy S23 (5.9 ounces). One change Google made that I wish it hadn't is to get rid of the two-tone color look of the Pixel 6, where the strip above the camera bar was a brighter hue than the rest of the phone. Instead, it's one solid color on the Pixel 7, with your choices being Obsidian (black), Snow (white) and Lemongrass (a muted lime green). On my Lemongrass review unit, some of the interface elements are keyed to that color as well, a nice implementation of Google's Material You interface. Google has stuck with rounded edges on the Pixel 7, which will please some people, even if I'm Team Flat Edge. I find phones with flat sides easier to keep hold of, and indeed, there have been times during my Pixel 7 testing where I've nearly lost my grip. Those edges also make it easy to brush the Pixel's screen accidentally, launching things you had no intention of summoning. At least twice when taking photos, I inadvertently changed photo modes without noticing, ruining both shots. Google Pixel 7 review: Display At 6.3-inches, the OLED display on the Pixel 7 is slightly smaller than the Pixel 6's 6.4-inch panel, though you'd need to have the phones side by side to really spot the difference. One key feature remains, though — like its predecessor, the Pixel 7 offers an adaptive 90Hz refresh rate. While not the 120Hz rate found on the Pixel 7 Pro, you still enjoy some smoother scrolling especially when compared to a phone with a 60Hz display like the iPhone 14. (Image credit: Tom's Guide) The big change with the Pixel 7 is that Google promises a brighter display that's capable of a peak brightness of 1,400 nits. We measured 926 nits with a light meter and adaptive brightness turned on. That's brighter than what we saw with the iPhone 14 (757 nits), but not as much as the 1,152 nits that the Galaxy S22 hit with HDR turned on. All the same, the Pixel 7's screen is bright enough to see outdoors, even in direct sunlight on a cloudless day. I did have to scale display brightness up to clearly see the phone's controls in the sun, but for the most part, the Pixel 7 display remains visible even under less-than-ideal circumstances. Swipe to scroll horizontally Row 0 - Cell 0 Google Pixel 7 Samsung Galaxy S23 Apple iPhone 14 Screen size 6.3-inch OLED 6.1-inch OLED 6.1-inch OLED Peak brightness (nits) 926 1,158 757 sRGB % 109.3% 212.1% (Vivid); 128.6% (Natural) 117.4% DCI-P3 % 77.4% 150.2% (Vivid); 91.1% (Natural) 83.1% Delta-E rating 0.28 0.24 0.25 In our lab tests, the Pixel 7 certainly came across as a colorful display, capturing 109.3% of the sRGB color spectrum and 77.4% of the more demanding DCI-P3 gamut. While those numbers roughly equaled the Galaxy S22, the subsequent release of the Galaxy S23 means Samsung's current flagship has a more colorful display. And the Galaxy S23 shows colors more accurately, too, with a 0.24 in its natural mode, compared to 0.28 for the Pixel 7. (Numbers closer to zero are more accurate.) The iPhone 14 beats the Pixel 7 here, too, scoring 0.25. (Image credit: Tom's Guide) Certainly, just in watching videos, you wouldn't fault the Pixel 7 display for a lack of color. Watching Elvis stream on HBO Max, the King's sparkling white jumpsuit shone out in a dimly lit Vegas showroom, while Encanto on Disney Plus recreated all the vibrant colors of the Casa Madrigal. If I have a complaint about the Pixel 7's display, it's the bezel at the bottom of the screen, which is noticeably thicker than what you see on other flagship phones these days. The Pixel 6 had a thick bezel, too, but maybe in the ensuing year, I've gotten more used to edge-to-edge displays. Whatever the reason, the bezel bugged me in a way it didn't previously. Google Pixel 7 review: Cameras Cameras remain the Pixel's calling card, though that's not because of any substantial hardware changes to the Pixel 7's setup. Like the Pixel 6, the Pixel 7 offers you a 50MP main camera and a 12MP ultrawide lens, each with the same apertures as last year. There's no dedicated telephoto lens on the Pixel 7 as there is on the Pixel 7 Pro, but the new Tensor chipset powering the phone does improve Google's Super Res Zoom capability to offer an 8x digital zoom. (More on how that pays off below.) (Image credit: Tom's Guide) The front camera sees the biggest change, with an upgrade to a 10.8MP sensor with a wider 92.8 degree field of view. It was just 84 degrees for the Pixel 6's 8MP selfie cam. The wider field of view should allow you squeeze more people comfortably into any front camera shots. But first, let's consider the Pixel 7's rear cameras and how they match up against some of the best camera phones out there. We'll start with these geraniums, which the Pixel 7 captures in a cool shot that lends a blue cast to the photo. It's an all right effort, but I prefer the brighter colors in the iPhone 14's photo. Some might argue that the iPhone's Photonic Engine has oversaturated the green leaves, but I think the warmer tone makes for a better shot. The Pixel's cool tone returns in this overhead shot of a frittata, though here the colorcast is more appropriate than the pumped-up colors in the Galaxy S22's photo. The eggs are too bright in the Galaxy S22's shot, looking unnatural, while the Pixel keeps the yellow of the eggs, the green spinach leaves and the red salsa in balance. Even the glare from an overhead light on the plate isn't too distracting. The Pixel 7's aptitude for getting color right is also on display with this trio of apples that I positioned on a rack in a not particularly well-light portion of my kitchen. That doesn't stop the Pixel 7 from showcasing the apples in three distinct — and natural-looking — colors. The Galaxy S22's effort makes the apple on the right look overly orange and I don't think the one on the left looks particularly natural either. That said, the S22 does a better job of recreating the different colors and patterns on the cookbooks in the background, which seem to blend together in the Pixel's shot. Of course, phone makers don't stay in one place, and Samsung's Galaxy S23 corrects a lot of the S22's faults with over-saturated colors. This outdoor garden scene remains somewhat saturated in the Galaxy S23 shot, but it's much more accurate than the Pixel 7's photo in terms of color. That blue cast typical of some Pixel photos is really in evidence here to the detriment of the overall shot. Google says the new chipset powering its phone speeds up the Night Sight mode so that pictures are captured in the dark twice as fast. That means less time you have to hold your phone perfectly still, and less of a chance that an inadvertently shake will introduce noise or blur into your low-light shot. The Pixel 7 certainly captured this Halloween scene with more speed than the iPhone 14 did. I'm not sure it translated to a markedly better picture. The iPhone's shot has brighter colors, particularly that floral arrangement on the table, while the shadows look a bit spookier to my eye. That said, the Pixel 7's shot is a little sharper — there's not as much noise around the baby skeleton seated in the other skeleton's lap. Either shot sets the right mood for Halloween. Image 1 of 3 Galaxy S23 (Image credit: Tom's Guide) iPhone 14 (Image credit: Tom's Guide) Pixel 7 (Image credit: Tom's Guide) Google isn't the only one to focus on night photography, as it's also an area Samsung has been touting for the Galaxy S23. In this shot of a mural at night captured by all three leading camera phones, you can really see the S23's improvements on display. Yes, the shot struggles with some of the ambient street light, but there's not the fuzziness and noise you sometimes see in night photos — which is very much in evidence in the Pixel 7 photo. Neither the S23 nor the Pixel 7 has the best photo here — that honor goes to the iPhone 14 — but I think Google's phone is clearly the worst of the bunch. Some unforgiving sunlight at a miniature golf course made this shot of my daughter lining up a putt more complex than I thought it would be. Both the Pixel and iPhone do a decent job handling the multicolored carpets, the bright blue sky and the nearby grass, even if they wind up making the red schoolhouse look more muted than it was in real life. But my daughter winds up overpowered by shadows — she doesn't really stand out in either shot, even though she's the focal point of the photo. I'd give the edge to the Pixel here, as the iPhone's photo has a slightly hazy look, but neither photo is a standout. An ultrawide view of one of the more ornate castles you'll ever find at a miniature golf course gives me a chance to compare those lenses on the Pixel 7 and iPhone 14. The Pixel 7's ultrawide shooter is more than up to the job, still recreating the tiling on the roof and the brickwork on the castle, which pops out against the bright blue sky. The castle's too dark in the iPhone's effort, so those details are harder to see. Some of the palm trees to the right also have a more pronounced bend. A portrait shot of my daughter enjoying some ice cream turns out to be pretty evenly matched. Both phones captured her skin tone well, though the Pixel 7 obscured her freckles more than the iPhone 14 did. Both phones also struggled separating the subject from the background — the iPhone 14 blurred my daughter's face mask as well as strands of loose hair on both sides of her head while the Pixel 7 struggled mostly with the strands on the right. Either photo is fine, though. My daughter and I squeezed together for a selfie to see what kind of difference the Pixel 7's wider field of view made, and indeed, both of us fit comfortably into one shot. With the Galaxy S22, I ended up having to squeeze behind my daughter just to fit into the shot. Still, I think the S22 did a better job with skin tone — my face is nowhere near as red as it is in the Pixel 7 photo. At least the Pixel 7 did a better job with the low lighting in this night-time selfie, as the S22 shot is a bit too dark. We can't let a discussion of the Pixel 7 cameras go without mentioning the video improvements Google is introducing. The key additions will sound very familiar to iPhone owners, as Active Stabilization looks to keep your videos steady, even as you move around and Cinematic Blur adds a shallow field of view to videos, resulting in a portrait-style blur around the subject of your shot. Any similarities to the iPhone's Action Mode and Cinematic Mode are surely coincidental. I gave Cinematic Blur a try by shooting a video of some Halloween decorations where I tried to keep the focus on some Halloween figurines. You can see a blur in the background, but it's hard to tell if it's a stylized blur or just shaky camera work on my part. The effect is probably more pronounced with busier backgrounds and less static subjects, but it's not something that impressed the way Cinematic Mode did when I first saw it. Google Pixel 7 review: Tensor features Some of the photo features outlined above are powered by the Google Tensor G2, the follow-up to last year's Google-designed system-on-chip that debuted with the Pixel 6. Google is sticking with its own silicon for its latest phone, with the Tensor G2 continuing to lean heavily on a Tensor Processing Unit that draws upon machine learning and artificial intelligence to provide Pixel owners with some rather unique experiences. The best of the bunch is a new photo-editing tool called Photo Unblur that does exactly what it's name implies — get rid of those less-than-stylistic blurs that mar your photos for crisper, cleaner shots. You can apply Photo Unblur to images captured with your Pixel 7, but the real value of the feature is that it works on photos shot on entirely different phones (so long as you're accessing them from your Pixel 7, presumably via the Photos app). I used Photo Unblur to clean up a shot of my daughter from seven years ago that I had captured with an iPhone 5c. Photo Unblur managed to take a murky, backlit image of her in a dimly lit room and smooth out the blur to call out features on her face. The end result isn't perfect, but it's more shareable than it was before.  I tested the Pixel 7 Photo Unblur feature on other photos — and the results were pretty amazing. Likewise, the Pixel 7 introduces improvements to Super Res Zoom, a feature for cleaning up digitally zoomed-in photos that predates the Tensor chipset. Even though the Pixel 7 lacks a dedicated telephoto lens, it can turn to the 50MP main camera and use Super Res Zoom to crop down to a 12.5MP image when you opt for a 2x digital zoom The Pixel 7's 2x zoom of downtown Oakland shot across the San Leandro channel looks pretty good, even without the benefit of an optical zoom. The front of the image is as clear and precise as the zoom produced by the Galaxy S22's telephoto lens, and you really have to look hard to find any photographic noise toward the opposite shoreline. A little more fuzziness creeps in when we move to a 5x zoom, though the Pixel 7's shot is still perfectly passable. The words on the Tribune Tower are just as legible in the Pixel's shot as they are in the Galaxy S22's photo. Both zoom photos are clearly better on the Galaxy S22, but the Pixel 7 is at least able to hold its own thanks to the revamped Super Res Zoom feature. The Tensor chip doesn't stop with smartening up photo features. There are everyday capabilities it enables, too. Perhaps you remember the Direct My Call feature that Google introduced with the Pixel 6, in which the Google Assistant could display a list of call directory options, sparing you from having to remember what number to press. With the Pixel 7, those numbers appear right away. (Image credit: Tom's Guide) I put in a call to Home Depot's 800-number, and a text directory appeared on my Pixel 7's screen almost immediately after the automated system picked up the call. Google says it will be like that for a lot of popular toll-free numbers at launch, with more businesses being added over time. Other examples of the Tensor G2's improved smarts have materialized since the phone's release. The new chipset can transcribe audio messages your friends text to you — handy when you're in a place where you can't play the message. A software update in December has brought more promised features, highlighted by the ability to label different speakers in the auto-generated transcripts of the Recorder app. ( I still love the Recorder app , and it's better than ever on the Pixel 7.) Clear Calling is going live, too, promising improved audio quality on phone calls. Google Pixel 7 review: Performance It's a good thing that the Tensor chipset powers so many unique features, because it's still not the silicon to turn to for the ultimate mobile performance. The gap has narrowed between Google's latest Pixels and devices powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 from Qualcomm . But the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 that powers newer phones like the Galaxy S23 and OnePlus 11 has widened the gulf between Google's latest Pixels and other top Android phones. (Image credit: Tom's Guide) The Pixel 7 turned in respectable scores of 1,054 single-core and 3,021 multicore when we ran Geekbench 5 to measure overall performance. That compares to 1,024 and 3,348, respectively for the Galaxy S22, while the Galaxy Z Fold 4, running a newer Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 chipset, finished with 1,328 single core and 3,831 multicore results. The iPhone 14, with its A15 Bionic chipset, bested all three of those Android phones, though the Galaxy S23 with its Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip is putting up a decent fight. Swipe to scroll horizontally Row 0 - Cell 0 Google Pixel 7 Galaxy S23 Apple iPhone 14 Galaxy Z Fold 4 CPU Tensor G2 Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy A15 Bionic Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 Geekbench, single-core 1,054 1,582 1,727 1,328 Geekbench, multicore 3,021 4,876 4,553 3,831 Adobe Premiere Rush video encode (mins:secs) 0:48 0:39 0;28 0:46 Since our initial Pixel 7 review, we had the chance to run 3DMark's Wild Life Unlimited graphics benchmark on Google's phone. Again, the gap with other Android phones is noticeable, as the Pixel 7 produced 40.3 frames per second to the Galaxy S23's 87.3 fps result. Still, graphics looked sharp when I played PUBG Mobile on the Pixel 7 with nary a dropped frame or stutter, so I imagine once we get graphics benchmarks running on the Pixel 7, they'll tell an encouraging story. Really, my only complaint about gaming comes down to sound, as the Pixel 7's stereo speakers are too easy to cover up when you game in horizontal mode. Add to the fact that there's not much gradation as you adjust the sound — the Pixel 7's audio range seems to jump from ""too quiet"" to ""much too loud"" with little space in between — and it's hard to immerse yourself in games, no matter how sharp the graphics look. In our real-world test, where we have each phone transcode a 4K video to 1080p in Adobe Premiere Rush, the Pixel 7 finished the task in 47.6 seconds, which is roughly the same time as the 47 seconds the Galaxy S22 took. (The Galaxy S23 shaves 9 seconds off its predecessor's time.) The iPhone remains the king of this task with the new iPhone 14 needing just 28 seconds, but at least the Pixel 7 is keeping pace with other top Android devices. (Image credit: Tom's Guide) One of the disappointments with the Pixel 6 last year involved the phone's fingerprint sensor. The under-display sensor was slow to respond when it even could recognize your fingerprint at all. Google has improved things with the Pixel 7's sensor, which at least speeds up the unlocking process. I still find the reader to be pretty persnickety, though, refusing to read your fingerprint when you touch the screen with just a tip of your finger — you've got to lay the whole finger flat on the screen to have any chance of regular success. Happily, you're no longer dependent on the fingerprint sensor to unlock your phone. The Pixel 7 adds face unlock, letting you unlock the device with a facial scan. The feature's so speedy, I often end up unlocking my Pixel with my face long before I can lay my finger in the proper place to unlock the handset the semi-old-fashioned way. Google Pixel 7 review: Battery life and charging Another area where the Pixel 6 failed to shine was its battery life. In our battery test — where phones are tasked with continuously surfing the web until they run out of power — last year's Google phone finished roughly 90 minutes behind the average time for smartphones. (Image credit: Tom's Guide) While the Tensor G2 promises better power efficiency, the Pixel 7 continues the trend of Google's phone struggling with our battery test. Perhaps, that's not a surprise: Google opted for a smaller 4,355 mAh power cell than the 4,614 mAh battery that powered the Pixel 6, so the Tensor was going to have to do a lot of heavy-lifting to get that battery life number up. And during my use of the phone, I saw the Pixel 7's battery dip precipitously, albeit during intensive testing that doesn't really mirror real-world use. The results of our testing are pretty grim. With the 90Hz refresh rate turned off, Google's phone lasted a little more than 7 hours on our test — about 3 hours off the pace of the average smartphone. That's a poor first impression. Swipe to scroll horizontally Phone Battery size Battery life (Hrs:Mins) Google Pixel 7 4,355 mAh 7:13 (90Hz) Samsung Galaxy S23 3,900 mAh 10:27 (120Hz) iPhone 14 3,279 mAh 9:28 (60Hz) Samsung Galaxy S22 3,700 mAh 7:51 (120Hz) Google Pixel 6 4,614 mAh 8:13 (90Hz) Allegedly, the Pixel 7 can support 30W charging, but Google said the same thing last year, when the top speed was closer to 23W. We only had a 20W charger on hand when it came time to recharge a drained Pixel 7, and only got to 41% after 30 minutes. The iPhone 14, which is capped at 20W charging, got to 54% in that same time. Google Pixel 7 review: Software and support The Pixel 7 arrives with Android 13 pre-installed. While not a major overhaul of Google's phone software, Android 13 does introduce some welcome changes to permissions and privacy. Google uses the Pixel phones to show off Android as it should be implemented, so if you want the full Android experience, this is the phone to get. But it's not necessarily the phone to get if you want that Android experience to last for years and years. While Google does promise five years of security updates, it only commits to three years of software updates, so come 2026, you're going to be in the market for a new phone. That may not sound too onerous until you remember that Samsung is beating Google at its own software support game, by promising four years of Android updates for flagship devices and some Galaxy A midrange models. Even OnePlus is expanding software support to surpass Google. The good news is that Pixel 7 owners get 5 years for free access to the Google One VPN . It offers encrypted access to websites, hiding your activity in the process. Google claims that the VPN uses “Protected computing” to ensure it’s theoretically impossible for people to link your browsing to you or your Google account. The Pixel 7 also has Clear Calling, which clears up phone calls to ensure you can heard what's going on — even if they're in a particularly noisy location . The Pixel Recorder has also improved its auto-transcription, letting the app differentiate between different speakers. One part of the phone's software to watch out for though is the Markup tool, which until recently could have its edits undone after the fact due to the way Google Pixels save edited files. Google Pixel 7 review: Verdict The Pixel 7 would be compelling enough if all it had to offer began and ended with its cameras. This is a phone that can go toe-to-toe with the iPhone 14 in photo face-offs, even emerging with some key wins. Given the importance of photography to most people, the Pixel 7 has to be considered a best phone contender. Add to that the Tensor-powered features and a bright, colorful display, and the case for the Pixel 7 becomes even more compelling. It doesn't hurt that the Pixel 7 is the least expensive phone in its class. Yet, I'd be a bit more enthusiastic in my recommendation if battery life were better or if Google boosted software support to match other Android phone makers. At least the arrival of additional Tensor features increases the value of the Pixel 7. Thanks to a telephoto lens and an attractive price of its own, the Pixel 7 Pro looks like the more compelling of the two phones. There's also the possibility of the Pixel 7a , which will likely feature the same Tensor G2 chipset as the Pixel 7 and a lower price when it arrives at some point this year. But if I didn't want to spend more than $600 on a smartphone and I needed a device right now, the Pixel 7 more than fits the bill and gives you a very solid handset in return.

It has a QD-OLED panel, promising some of the brightest and most vibrant colors available on a TV. It has Samsung's LaserSlim Design, Neural Quantum Processor 4k AI upscaling with Quantum HDR OLED technology, and Motion Xcelerator Turbo Pro for enhanced motion processing. This TV officially supports 4k @ 144Hz, or 4k @ 120Hz on the 83-inch model, so it's a gaming powerhouse, especially with its full HDMI 2.1 Bandwidth support on all four HDMI ports. Like other Samsung TVs, it uses Samsung's proprietary Tizen OS smart interface, which offers a large selection of apps and games. It's available in four sizes: 55-inch, 65-inch, 77-inch, and a WOLED-equipped 83-inch size. Our Verdict 9.0 Mixed Usage The Samsung S90C is a fantastic TV for every usage. It has good SDR peak brightness, so it's great for watching TV shows or sports in a bright room, especially with its superb reflection handling. It truly shines for HDR movies and games, especially in a dark room where its OLED panel, with its deep inky blacks, truly performs at its best. The very low input lag makes it fantastic for gamers, as your inputs are translated almost instantaneously to the screen. Its superb response time makes it a great choice for fans of fast-moving content, whether sports or games, as action stays clear and crisp throughout. Sadly it doesn't support any DTS audio formats, making it tricky for a home entertainment center, and it only has adequate low-quality content smoothing, which isn't optimal for streaming services with low bitrates. Pros Near-infinite contrast ratio for perfect blacks. Superb reflection handling. Incredibly bright colors. Cons Aggressive ABL can get distracting with large areas of brightness. Searching Finding Store See our Mixed Usage Recommendations 8.6 TV Shows The Samsung S90C is excellent for watching TV shows in a bright room. It has good SDR peak brightness and incredible reflection handling, so it can easily overcome glare in a bright room. It has a truly exceptional viewing angle, which is great for a wide seating area or for moving around the TV while watching it, as the image remains consistent. It also upscales lower-resolution content well, and the smart interface has a great selection of streaming apps, so you're sure to find your favorite shows. Unfortunately, its low-quality content smoothing is only adequate, so low-resolution or low-bitrate TV shows will have macro-blocking, even if upscaled well. Pros Superb reflection handling. Exceptionally wide viewing angle. Good peak brightness in SDR. Cons Aggressive ABL can get distracting with large areas of brightness. Searching Finding Store See our TV Shows Recommendations 8.9 Sports The Samsung S90C is an incredible TV for watching sports. It has exceptional reflection handling, which is great when watching shows in a room with glare, and the TV has good SDR brightness, so it handles bright rooms well. The TV's viewing angle is superb, so the image remains consistent even when viewing the TV from the side, so those sitting off-center will have a pleasant viewing experience. It has an incredible response time, so motion, like fast-moving players, is crisp and sharp, with no blurring. The TV has spectacular color uniformity, so when watching sports with large areas of uniform color, like hockey, you won't be distracted by annoying smudges or color variations in the image. Finally, the very good low-resolution upscaling means that sports are upscaled well without any weird artifacts. Pros Superb reflection handling. Exceptionally wide viewing angle. Good peak brightness in SDR. Cons Aggressive ABL can get distracting with large areas of brightness. Searching Finding Store See our Sports Recommendations 9.4 Video Games The Samsung S90C is a fantastic TV for immersing your evenings in virtual gaming worlds. Enabling Game Mode doesn't noticeably affect image quality, so your games look great and feel super responsive due to the TV's incredibly low input lag. The TV has fantastic reflection handling and good peak brightness in SDR, making it a good choice for bright rooms or rooms with glare. The response time is exceptionally low, so you won't have any blur or ghosting when the action gets hectic. It also officially supports 4k @ 144Hz (120Hz on the 83-inch model), making this a standout TV for gamers. Pros Superb reflection handling. HDMI 2.1 bandwidth on all four ports. Good peak brightness in SDR. Incredibly low input lag. Cons Searching Finding Store See our Video Games Recommendations 8.9 HDR Movies The Samsung S90C is an excellent TV for watching the latest hit movies. Like all OLEDs, it has incredible contrast, with deep inky blacks and no blooming around bright highlights. And that's good, as its highlights get quite bright due to its very good HDR peak brightness. It also has excellent low-resolution upscaling, so your legacy DVD movies will look great. This TV has an incredible color gamut, truly excellent accuracy, and barely any HDR gradient banding, so HDR looks vibrant without any real calibration. Unfortunately, the TV has low-quality content smoothing; it's alright and preserves details well, but content like low-bitrate streaming services have macro blocking in dark scenes. It also doesn't support any DTS audio formats, so Blu-rays and DVDs don't sound their best as they tend to use DTS for their audio tracks. Pros Near-infinite contrast ratio for perfect blacks. Removes 24p judder from any source. Incredibly bright colors. Amazing color gamut in HDR. Cons Doesn't support DTS passthrough or Dolby Vision. Fast response time results in noticeable stutter. Aggressive ABL can get distracting with large areas of brightness. Searching Finding Store 9.3 HDR Gaming The Samsung S90C is an outstanding TV for playing HDR titles. Enabling Game Mode slightly increases overall HDR brightness, making the TV less accurate but making games look bright and punchy. The TV has remarkably low input lag with Game Mode on, so games feel super responsive. The TV can handle all commonly used resolutions and officially supports 4k @ 144Hz (120Hz on the 83-inch model). It has fantastic reflection handling and great HDR brightness in Game Mode , so you'll enjoy gaming on this TV even on a bright, sunny day, although, like most OLEDs, it truly shines in a dark room. The response time is exceptionally low, so you won't have any blur or ghosting even when playing through the most intense scenes. Pros Near-infinite contrast ratio for perfect blacks. HDMI 2.1 bandwidth on all four ports. Incredibly bright colors. Incredibly low input lag. Amazing color gamut in HDR. Cons Over brightened in HDR Game Mode . Doesn't support DTS passthrough or Dolby Vision. Aggressive ABL can get distracting with large areas of brightness. Searching Finding Store 9.5 PC Monitor The Samsung S90C is a fantastic TV for PC gaming. It has a nearly-instantaneous response time and incredibly low input lag, so inputs are fluid and responsive, with almost no distracting motion blur behind fast-moving objects. Its viewing angle is amazing, so even if you sit in front of the TV, you won't notice any discoloration or dimming at the edges. It has good peak brightness in SDR and amazing reflection handling, so it'll look great even if your office setup is in a bright room or in front of some windows. Unfortunately, this TV doesn't use a standard RGB subpixel layout, so text isn't very clear when used as a monitor, and there is color fringing at the edges of bright windows or images due to the subpixel structure of QD-OLED panels. Finally, as with all OLEDs, there's a risk of permanent burn-in when exposed to static elements, like the UI elements of a computer desktop. Pros Superb reflection handling. Exceptionally wide viewing angle. HDMI 2.1 bandwidth on all four ports. Incredibly low input lag. Cons Noticeable color fringing. Risk of permanent burn-in . Aggressive ABL can get distracting with large areas of brightness.

Show more Differences Between Sizes And Variants We bought and tested the 65-inch Samsung S90C, and these results are also valid for the 55-inch and 77-inch models. The 83-inch model uses a WOLED panel instead of the QD-OLED panel found in the smaller sizes, so our results don't apply to it. Note that the last five letters in the model number (AFXZA in this case) vary between retailers and individual regions, but there's no difference in performance. There are also regional models, like the Samsung S92C and the Samsung S93C, but they're identical to the Samsung S90C. It's also sold as the Samsung S90CD at warehouse stores like Costco and Sam's Club. The S90CD offers the same features, picture quality, and processing capabilities but has more powerful speakers (60W vs. 40W on the S90C) and a longer warranty.

There's a lot of confusing information about this model, as it seems to use different panels in different regions. In North America, it's known as the S89CB, and according to user reports , it uses a QD-OLED panel similar to the S90C. In this case, the main difference between that model and the S90C is that the S89CB doesn't support Filmmaker mode. In Europe, it's advertised as the S89C, without the 'B' at the end, and it appears to use a WOLED panel from LG Display, similar to the LG C3 OLED or the Sony A80L/A80CL OLED . It has worse color volume and a slightly narrower color gamut, and like the North American model, it doesn't support Filmmaker mode; otherwise, it performs about the same as the S90C. The Samsung S92C is a Canadian variant available in-store exclusively at Best Buy, but you can also purchase it online directly from Samsung. It offers the same picture quality and features as the S90C, but it has a 60W 2.1.2 channel speaker setup as opposed to the 40W 2.1 channel setup on the S90C. Our unit was manufactured in March 2023; you can see the label here . Compared To Other TVs The Samsung S90C is an incredible OLED TV. It feels and looks like a repackaged Samsung S95B OLED but with official 4k @ 144Hz support. It doesn't get as bright as the Samsung S95C OLED or the LG G3 OLED , but it's still incredibly bright and vibrant, more so than the LG C3 OLED . Overall, it's a very impressive TV and is a better buy for most people than the more expensive S95C. See our recommendations for the best OLED TVs , the best 4k TVs , and the best TVs for watching movies . Samsung S90D OLED 42"" (WOLED) 48"" (WOLED) 55"" (QD-OLED) 65"" (QD-OLED) 77"" (QD-OLED) 83"" (WOLED) Searching Finding Store The Samsung S90D OLED is marginally better than the Samsung S90C OLED. The S90D is a bit brighter in HDR, so highlights in HDR content stand out a little bit more, and it has better color volume, so it can display very bright colors a bit better. The S90D also has slightly better processing, so there's less banding in colors, and it does a better job with smoothing out low-quality content. Compare Side-by-Side SEE OUR REVIEW LG C4 OLED 42"" 48"" 55"" 65"" 77"" 83"" Searching Finding Store The Samsung S90C OLED and the LG C4 OLED are similar TVs with only a few key differences. They're very similar in peak brightness, although the LG is noticeably dimmer in Game Mode while the Samsung isn't, making the Samsung the better choice for gamers. The LG is the better choice for movie fans, as it supports Dolby Vision HDR and passes through advanced DTS audio formats. The LG also has slightly better image processing than the Samsung, especially when watching low-bitrate content from streaming services due to its superior low-quality content smoothing. Compare Side-by-Side SEE OUR REVIEW LG C3 OLED 42"" 48"" 55"" 65"" 77"" 83"" Searching Finding Store The LG C3 OLED and the Samsung S90C OLED are similar TVs occupying the same market position. Of the two, the Samsung is the better gaming TV and slightly better overall TV, while the LG is the better TV for movie fans. The Samsung has a wider color gamut and gets brighter than the LG, especially in HDR; not only that, but it also maintains its HDR brightness better in Game Mode. It also supports 4k @ 144Hz (120Hz on the 83-inch model), while the LG is limited to 4k @ 120Hz. However, the LG supports DTS audio formats and Dolby Vision, making it great for Blu-ray fans. It also has better low-quality content smoothing than the Samsung TV, making it better for watching streaming content, especially in low-bitrate situations. Compare Side-by-Side SEE OUR REVIEW Samsung S95C OLED 55"" 65"" 77"" Searching Finding Store The Samsung S95C OLED is a bit better than the Samsung S90C OLED for basically only two reasons. First, the S95C has a sleeker, more uniform design, helped by moving all of its inputs to the external One Connect box. This makes the S95C a better bet for someone who knows they want to wall mount their TV and want it to look the best on their wall. Second, the S95C gets much brighter than the S90C, although this won't be that noticeable in practice except in a few super bright scenes. Compare Side-by-Side SEE OUR REVIEW LG B4 OLED 48"" 55"" 65"" 77"" 83"" Searching Finding Store The Samsung S90C OLED is better than the LG B4 OLED . The S90C gets brighter in HDR, so highlights pop more on it. The S90C also displays more vibrant, lifelike, and bright colors overall due to its wider color gamut and better color volume, and its better viewing angle means that there is very little color shift when watching the TV from an angle. However, the B4 has better image processing, so low-resolution and low-quality content looks better on it, and it supports Dolby Vision and DTS audio formats. Compare Side-by-Side SEE OUR REVIEW LG G4 OLED 55"" 65"" 77"" 83"" 97"" Searching Finding Store The LG G4 OLED is a bit better than the Samsung S90C OLED, but they're extremely similar. The LG gets a bit brighter than the Samsung, so bright highlights in HDR pop a bit more on it. The LG is also noticeably brighter in SDR content and has the better image processing of the two TVs, although the Samsung does have the edge when it comes to HDR gradients. The Samsung is the more colorful of the two TVs, so particularly colorful content will look more vibrant on the Samsung TV. Ultimately, the biggest difference between the two is likely the LG's support for Dolby Vision HDR and advanced DTS audio formats, making it the better option for physical media enthusiasts. Compare Side-by-Side SEE OUR REVIEW Samsung S95D OLED 55"" 65"" 77"" Searching Finding Store The Samsung S95D OLED and the Samsung S90C OLED are very similar TVs, but there are some differences. The S95D has better color volume, so it can display colors in HDR brighter. On the other hand, the S90C has better color accuracy before calibration, which is great if you care about SDR accuracy without needing to get the TV calibrated. The S95D uses a matte screen finish that does an amazing job of eliminating reflections caused by glare, but it comes at the cost of picture quality when the TV is used in a room with lights on. The S95D also comes with Samsung's Slim One Connect Box, so it's more versatile if you need easier access to its ports. Compare Side-by-Side SEE OUR REVIEW Samsung QN90C 43"" 50"" 55"" 65"" 75"" 85"" Searching Finding Store In most ways, the Samsung S90C OLED is better than the Samsung QN90C . Due to the S90C's nearly infinite contrast ratio, it displays perfect blacks with no blooming around bright objects. The S90C has a much wider viewing angle, so it's the better option for watching TV as a group, and its wider color gamut delivers more lifelike colors. The S90C is also better for PC gamers due to its 4k @ 144Hz support. However, the QN90C has better SDR brightness, so it's better if you primarily watch TV in a very bright room. Compare Side-by-Side SEE OUR REVIEW LG G3 OLED 55"" 65"" 77"" 83"" Searching Finding Store The LG G3 OLED and Samsung S90C OLED are comparable OLEDs, each with its strengths. The LG has a flat back and is meant to be wall mounted; it doesn't have a stand to emphasize this. The Samsung TV instead has a more typical side profile with a stand. The LG gets brighter than the Samsung in HDR, but the latter outputs more vibrant colors. The Samsung also supports 4k @ 144Hz (120Hz on the 83-inch model), while the LG is limited to 4k @ 120Hz. The Samsung also has a much wider color gamut and more accurate colors, so it's great for HDR gaming. However, the LG supports DTS audio formats and Dolby Vision making it great for Blu-ray movie fans, and it also has better low-quality content smoothing, making it better for watching streaming content, especially in low-bitrate situations. Compare Side-by-Side SEE OUR REVIEW Samsung S95B OLED 55"" 65"" Searching Finding Store The Samsung S95B OLED and the Samsung S90C OLED are almost identical. Indeed, the S90C looks like a repackaged S95B but with official 4k @ 144Hz (120Hz on the 83-inch model) support, the 2023 version of their proprietary Tizen OS, and new 77"" and 83"" (with a WOLED panel) models alongside the existing 55"" and 65"" ones. The S90C is also a bit brighter than the S95B, but everything else is identical. Compare Side-by-Side SEE OUR REVIEW Samsung S85D OLED 55"" 65"" 77"" 83"" Searching Finding Store The Samsung S90C OLED is better than the Samsung S85D OLED . The S90C has a wider color gamut and much better color volume, so it displays more vibrant and lifelike colors with less banding. The S90C has much better pre-calibration SDR accuracy, so you don't need to get it calibrated if you care about accurate colors in SDR. Highlights in HDR content pop out more on the S90C due to its better HDR brightness, and it maintains that brightness while using Game Mode. If you're a PC gamer with a higher-end graphics card, the S90C supports 4k @ 144Hz, so you can play in a higher frame rate. Compare Side-by-Side SEE OUR REVIEW Sony A80L/A80CL OLED 55"" 65"" 77"" 83"" Searching Finding Store The Samsung S90C OLED is better than the Sony A80L/A80CL OLED . The Samsung is brighter overall, so it can handle more glare when watching SDR content, and highlights in HDR content stand out more. The Samsung also has a wider color gamut and better color volume, so colors are more vibrant and lifelike. On top of that, the Samsung model is the better option for gamers due to its lower input lag, and PC gamers can take advantage of its ability to game in up to 4k @ 144Hz. Compare Side-by-Side SEE OUR REVIEW LG C2 OLED 42"" 48"" 55"" 65"" 77"" 83"" Searching Finding Store The Samsung S90C OLED is a bit better than the LG C2 OLED . The LG TV does support Dolby Vision, while the Samsung uses the least widespread HDR10+ format, so some Dolby Vision content might look better on the LG. Otherwise, the Samsung has a slight but noticeable advantage in all other areas: it's brighter in HDR, has a noticeably wider color gamut, and is more accurate. The Samsung is also better for PC gamers because it has four 4k @ 144Hz HDMI 2.1 ports versus four 4k @ 120Hz ports on the LG. Compare Side-by-Side SEE OUR REVIEW Sony A75L OLED 55"" 65"" Searching Finding Store The Samsung S90C OLED is slightly better than the Sony A75L OLED . The Samsung TV uses a different type of OLED panel known as QD-OLED. This panel delivers a similar dark room experience, so both TVs deliver deep, inky blacks with perfect uniformity. The big difference between them is colors, as the Samsung delivers much brighter, purer colors and a wider color gamut. If you care more about creative intent, the Sony is a better choice, but if you enjoy punchy, vibrant colors, go with the Samsung instead. Compare Side-by-Side SEE OUR REVIEW Sony X93L/X93CL 65"" 75"" 85"" Searching Finding Store The Samsung S90C OLED is better than the Sony X93L/X93CL except perhaps for two crowds: viewers who mostly watch SDR content in bright rooms and movie purists who want the Sony TV's better image processing, Dolby Vision support, and DTS advanced audio passthrough. Otherwise, the Samsung TV is the better product; it has much better contrast due to its nearly infinite contrast ratio, is almost as bright in HDR, and is the more colorful of the two TVs. The Samsung is also the much better gaming TV due to its nearly instantaneous response time, lower input lag, and four 4k @ 144Hz HDMI ports. Compare Side-by-Side SEE OUR REVIEW LG C1 OLED 48"" 55"" 65"" 77"" 83"" Searching Finding Store The Samsung S90C OLED is better than the LG C1 OLED . The LG model has one advantage over the Samsung TV: Dolby Vision support. Still, the Samsung is much brighter in HDR and SDR and is the more colorful of the two, so Dolby Vision alone doesn't compensate for the Samsung's image quality advantage. Plus, if you care about accuracy, the Samsung TV has you covered here, too, as it is much more accurate than the LG in SDR. The Samsung is also the better PC gaming TV due to its four 4k @ 144Hz HDMI ports, while the LG has four 4k @ 120Hz ports. Compare Side-by-Side SEE OUR REVIEW Samsung S89C OLED 77"" Searching Finding Store The Samsung S89C OLED is a variant of the Samsung S90C OLED, and they're identical outside of the S89C coming with feet instead of a stand. There are some minute differences, such as the S89C being a bit brighter in HDR but slightly dimmer in SDR and being significantly less color-accurate, but these differences are likely due to panel variance rather than highlighting a true difference between the two models. Compare Side-by-Side SEE OUR REVIEW Hisense U8K 55"" 65"" 75"" 85"" 100"" Searching Finding Store The Samsung S90C OLED is better than the Hisense U8K . The Hisense is slightly better for bright rooms due to it being the brightest TV of the two, especially when watching HDR content. The Hisense is also great for movie purists due to its Dolby Vision support and advanced DTS audio passthrough. Still, the Samsung is a bright TV with tremendous reflection handling, so it's no slouch in bright rooms, but it truly excels in dark rooms due to its nearly infinite contrast ratio. The Samsung also has a vastly wider viewing angle, making it better for wide seating arrangements. Plus, it's the far better gaming TV, with a faster response time and four 4k @ 144Hz HDMI ports, versus two on the Hisense.

The QN95C is the brighter TV of the two, especially in SDR, so it's preferable for bright room scenarios. Still, the S90C is also quite bright in HDR and has better contrast, so it looks better in dark rooms and almost as good in brighter rooms when watching HDR content. Otherwise, the S90C has typical OLED advantages: a much wider viewing angle, a near-instantaneous response time for gamers, and superior screen uniformity. Compare Side-by-Side SEE OUR REVIEW Sony A80J OLED 55"" 65"" 77"" Searching Finding Store The Samsung S90C OLED is much better than the Sony A80J OLED . The Samsung has a QD-OLED panel, allowing it to get brighter and display a wider range of colors than the Sony. The Samsung TV also has better gaming performance due to its lower input lag. However, if you use your TV in a bright room, the Sony performs better because blacks still look black in a bright room, whereas ambient lighting causes the black levels to raise and become purple-tinged on the Samsung. Compare Side-by-Side SEE OUR REVIEW LG B3 OLED 55"" 65"" 77"" Searching Finding Store The Samsung S90C OLED and LG B3 OLED are both amazing TVs, and while the LG has a few features that the Samsung doesn't have, the S90C is the better TV overall. The Samsung gets much brighter in HDR and SDR, with a wider color gamut and better color volume, so all content looks significantly more vibrant on the Samsung. It also has four full HDMI 2.1 bandwidth ports, all capable of up to 4k @ 144Hz (120Hz on the 83-inch model), making it the better TV for gamers.

The materials used feel premium, and while there's some flex on the component housing on the back, the panel itself is made of metal and is resistant to flexing. There's some wobble on the stand when the TV is pushed forward or backward, but it quickly settles. The two bottom corners of the screen are very slightly bowed back; it's extremely subtle, and you won't notice it unless you're looking for it. It was also a problem on the Samsung S95B OLED , which can worsen if you lift the TV repeatedly. Unfortunately, the display shows fingerprints easily; they can be difficult to remove. — Picture Quality 10 Picture Quality Contrast Contrast Inf : 1 Native Contrast Inf : 1 As OLED displays use self-emissive pixels instead of a backlight, pixels can independently brighten themselves up to their peak brightness, or inversely they can fully turn themselves off for perfect blacks. This ability to fully turn its pixels off gives OLEDs a nearly infinite contrast ratio, with bright highlights right next to perfect blacks with no blooming or haloing. — LEARN ABOUT CONTRAST 10 Picture Quality Blooming Since this TV uses self-emissive OLED technology, there's absolutely no blooming around bright highlights or subtitles in otherwise dark scenes. — 10 Picture Quality Lighting Zone Transitions Local Dimming No Backlight No Backlight Dimming Zones Count Of Tested TV 8,294,400 The panel doesn't have a backlight, but thanks to its nearly infinite contrast ratio, it has the equivalent of a perfect local dimming feature with no zone transitions.

As a result, we've retaken our brightness measurements with the color space set to 'Auto'. The Samsung S90C has excellent HDR peak brightness. Bright highlights are vibrant on this TV, although, like all OLEDs, the S90C has an aggressive Automatic Brightness Limiter (ABL), which significantly dims bright highlights when they take up a large portion of the screen. So scenes with a lot of bright areas, like a bright sunny day at the beach, are significantly dimmer on this TV than they are on a non-OLED panel.

Instead of having all three subpixels in a row, each pixel forms a triangle, with the larger green subpixel at the top. This leads to color fringing, which is noticeable when displaying any content with horizontal lines, and it's especially bad when you use the TV as a PC monitor. For example, on a bright window on a Windows PC, you might notice a green fringe at the top since that is where the green subpixel is. Similarly, you can notice a purple fringe at the bottom of bright windows, as that is where the red and blue subpixels are. Furthermore, with this subpixel arrangement, text has just okay clarity on a PC, as Windows ClearType settings aren't designed for this subpixel structure and can't correct it.
